## About
datapipes encourages to handle multi streamings asynchronously. datapipes has
a few objects sparated by its responsibility.

- __Source__ Produces resources and emits the resource to pipe.
- __Tube__ Effector for resources. Processes resource in the middle of pipe.
- __Sink__ Consumer for resources. Do something with processed resources.
- __Pipe__ Resources pass through the pipe. Handles resources asynchronously.

```
 Source
   |   â†“ data flow
   |
  Tube
   |    pipe is '|'
   |
  Sink
```

To handle multi streamings, datapipes offers composability. Source, Tube and Sink
are composable individually. So the diagram above will be:

```
 Composed Source works concurrently.

 Composed Sink works concurrently.

You can see how to compose objects in `examples/composing.rb`.

## Installation
__datapipes requires Ruby >= 2.0.__

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'datapipes'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install datapipes

## Usage
You have to define your own Source, Tube and Sink. See more in `examples`.

### Composing objects
See more in `examples/composing.rb`.
